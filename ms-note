As part of the OpenShift setup for MicroStrategy, the work can be divided into two key tasks that need to be completed:

MicroStrategy Operator Installation

The MicroStrategy Operator will be installed through Lightspeed.

This approach does not require a web UI and allows us to deploy the operator consistently across multiple OpenShift clusters.

MicroStrategy Environment Deployment

Teams will create MicroStrategy environments by applying MstrEnvironment Custom Resources within their own namespace.

Access is controlled via namespace-scoped RBAC, granting CRUD permissions only on mstrenvironments.

This setup enables a self-service model for application teams while maintaining proper access control and isolation.
=======================

Here are clear, meeting-ready bullet points that explain the contents in a structured and easy-to-follow way:

* **Namespace Setup**

  * Create a dedicated Kubernetes/OpenShift namespace for each team.
  * Add the namespace to the **ServiceMeshMemberRoll** to enable service mesh capabilities.

* **Access Control (RBAC)**

  * Assign **namespace-scoped RBAC** to each team.
  * RBAC is limited to **MicroStrategy Environment custom resources (`MstrEnvironment`) only**.
  * Teams do **not** get access to cluster-wide resources or operator-level permissions.

* **MicroStrategy Environment Management**

  * Teams create and manage MicroStrategy environments by applying **`MstrEnvironment` Custom Resources** within their own namespace.
  * Teams have **CRUD access only to `mstrenvironments`**, which is sufficient for environment lifecycle management.

* **Operator Responsibilities**

  * The **MicroStrategy Operator’s ServiceAccount** handles all underlying Kubernetes resources automatically, including:

    * Deployments
    * StatefulSets
    * PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)
    * Routes
    * Jobs
    * Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs)
  * Teams do not need direct access to these resources.

* **Role Design per Team**

  * Create **two namespace-scoped Roles per team**:

    * **Admin Role**: Full CRUD access to `mstrenvironments`
    * **Viewer Role**: Read-only access to `mstrenvironments`
  * Bind each role to a **separate OpenShift group**.

* **Security & Governance Benefits**

  * Clear separation of responsibilities between teams and the operator.
  * Full control over who can **create, modify, or view** MicroStrategy environments.
  * No exposure of the MicroStrategy Operator or Admin UI to application teams.
  * Follows least-privilege and namespace isolation best practices.
