Here are clear, meeting-ready bullet points that explain the contents in a structured and easy-to-follow way:

* **Namespace Setup**

  * Create a dedicated Kubernetes/OpenShift namespace for each team.
  * Add the namespace to the **ServiceMeshMemberRoll** to enable service mesh capabilities.

* **Access Control (RBAC)**

  * Assign **namespace-scoped RBAC** to each team.
  * RBAC is limited to **MicroStrategy Environment custom resources (`MstrEnvironment`) only**.
  * Teams do **not** get access to cluster-wide resources or operator-level permissions.

* **MicroStrategy Environment Management**

  * Teams create and manage MicroStrategy environments by applying **`MstrEnvironment` Custom Resources** within their own namespace.
  * Teams have **CRUD access only to `mstrenvironments`**, which is sufficient for environment lifecycle management.

* **Operator Responsibilities**

  * The **MicroStrategy Operator’s ServiceAccount** handles all underlying Kubernetes resources automatically, including:

    * Deployments
    * StatefulSets
    * PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)
    * Routes
    * Jobs
    * Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs)
  * Teams do not need direct access to these resources.

* **Role Design per Team**

  * Create **two namespace-scoped Roles per team**:

    * **Admin Role**: Full CRUD access to `mstrenvironments`
    * **Viewer Role**: Read-only access to `mstrenvironments`
  * Bind each role to a **separate OpenShift group**.

* **Security & Governance Benefits**

  * Clear separation of responsibilities between teams and the operator.
  * Full control over who can **create, modify, or view** MicroStrategy environments.
  * No exposure of the MicroStrategy Operator or Admin UI to application teams.
  * Follows least-privilege and namespace isolation best practices.
