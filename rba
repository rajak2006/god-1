Yes — **RoleBinding assigned to a group is valid**, but it’s important to understand **what scope it gives**.

There are **two different cases**:

---

# 1️⃣ RoleBinding → Group (Namespace scope)

This gives permissions **only inside one namespace**.

### Example

```bash
oc adm policy add-role-to-group admin mstr-ocp-admins -n mstr-operator
```

This means:

* Group: `mstr-ocp-admins`
* Role: `admin`
* Namespace: `mstr-operator`

So users in that group can:

* Create pods, services, secrets
* **Only in `mstr-operator` namespace**

They **cannot**:

* Create CRDs
* Install operators
* Create namespaces
* Do cluster-wide actions

---

# 2️⃣ ClusterRoleBinding → Group (Cluster scope) ✅ (what you need)

This gives permissions **across the entire cluster**.

### Example

```bash
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group cluster-admin mstr-ocp-admins
```

This means:

* Group: `mstr-ocp-admins`
* Role: `cluster-admin`
* Scope: whole cluster

So users in that group can:

* Create CRDs
* Install operators
* Create namespaces
* Manage everything

# How to check what your group has

### Namespace roles:

```bash
oc get rolebindings -A | grep mstr-ocp-admins
```

### Cluster roles:

```bash
oc get clusterrolebindings | grep mstr-ocp-admins
```

# How to test real power (best command)

```bash
oc auth can-i create crd --as-group=mstr-ocp-admins
```

| Result | Meaning                       |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| yes    | Group has cluster-level power |
| no     | Only namespace-level          |

# For MicroStrategy Operator

You **must have**:

* ClusterRoleBinding
* Not just RoleBinding

Because operator needs:

* CRDs
* Cluster roles
* Global resources

---

# One-line executive explanation

> RoleBinding grants permissions only within a namespace, while ClusterRoleBinding grants permissions across the entire cluster. For installing platform components like MicroStrategy Operator, permissions must be assigned using ClusterRoleBinding to a group.
